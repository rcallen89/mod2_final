# Monster Shop


## Background and Description

"Monster Shop" is a fictitious e-commerce platform where users can register to place items into a shopping cart and 'check out'. Users who work for a merchant can mark their items as 'fulfilled'; the last merchant to mark items in an order as 'fulfilled' will automatically set the order status to "shipped". Each user role will have access to some or all CRUD functionality for application models.


### Implementation Instructions
To set up locally:
 * Clone down the repository.
 * Run `bundle install`.
 * Run `rails db:{create,migrate,seed}` to setup the database.
 * Run `rails s` and navigate your browser to `localhost:3000` to use the development database.

### Functionality By User Type

### Visitor
A **visitor** to this website is classifed as anyone who is not currently logged in.

**Visitors** can:
 * visit the index of merchants,
 * visit the index of items,
 * add items to a cart,
 * view the cart,
 * both increase and decrease item quantity in cart, and;
 * can access both login and register routes.

### User
A **user** of this website has an account created with the site

Before one can access user functionality, they must have registered with the site.  Registration requires name, full address, unique email, and matching password fields in order to complete successfully.

A user can do all of the things a visitor can do, plus:
 * user has a profile page which displays all user information (except password),
 * profile page has edit profile and change password option, and;
 * if user has any open orders, they will have a "My Orders" link to view their orders.
 
A user's order index displays the following:
 * order ID,
 * number of items within the order,
 * status of the current order,
 * total cost of the order, and;
 * created and updated dates.

If a user clicks on their order ID, the order show page displays the following:
 * includes all of the above order information, plus;
 * breakdown by item, including name, image, price, quantity, description, and subtotal, and;
 * if order has not been shipped, there is an option to cancel the order.

If a user would like to proceed with their finalized order, they have the ability to:
* go to their cart, and;
* have a checkout option that, once clicked, will empty their cart.
